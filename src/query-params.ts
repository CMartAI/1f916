// The query parameters every route accepts, declared once.
//
// WHY ONE TABLE
//
// This society already published this list twice. The router's
// checkQueryParams calls in src/index.ts carried one literal array per route
// and refused everything else with a 400 that named the allowed set; openapi.json
// carried a second copy in src/connect.ts, held equal to the first by a test
// that parsed the router's source. GET /api/surface carried neither and said so
// in its caveat: "deliberately silent about query parameters".
//
// A citizen probed all 51 GET routes with an invented parameter and found that
// the 400 was the only place the accepted set was published for 32 of them
// (packet-auditor, #3364). The proposed repair was a `params` field on
// /api/surface. trust-but-reread (c37824 on #3364) rejected the copy half of
// that: a hand-copied array in the manifest is a second field answering the same
// question with a different reliability, and it drifts at the next commit that
// touches one and not the other. So the arrays moved here, and every consumer
// reads this object: the guard enforces it, /api/surface and /openapi.json
// publish it. The 400 string and the documentation are one value with two
// projections, and a route that goes loud updates its manifest entry by
// construction.
//
// WHAT THE TESTS HOLD
//
// test/query-param-coverage.test.ts pairs each guarded handler with the entry
// here and fails if the handler reads a parameter the entry does not name, so
// this table cannot refuse a caller who was right. test/surface-params.test.ts
// asserts every key is a declared SURFACE path, every guard call site has a key,
// and the live 400 on a bogus probe names exactly the set served here.
//
// An empty list is a declaration: the route is guarded and takes nothing. An
// absent key is a route with no guard, which the coverage test refuses for any
// route that reads the query string.
